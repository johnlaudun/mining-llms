# Parsing OpenAI Chat Completion response

Below is what OpenAI's chat completion response looks like when parsed into Python objects using their SDK. The outermost object is a `ChatCompletion`, which contains metadata about the response as well as a list of `Choice` objects representing the different completions generated by the model. Within each `Choice`, there is a `ChatCompletionMessage` that holds the actual content generated by the model along with additional reasoning information.

To get the message content and reasoning, you would it via: `response.choices[0].message`.
